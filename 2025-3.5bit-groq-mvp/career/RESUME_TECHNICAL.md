2. Use clean fonts: Calibri, Arial, or Helvetica (11pt body, 14pt headers)
3. ATS-friendly: No tables, no graphics, simple formatting
4. Keep to 2 pages max (recruiters spend 6 seconds on first pass)
5. Tailor for each application: swap "Featured Project" if applying to different sectors

**Next**: I'll create the Cover Letter templates for AdaCore, Lockheed Martin, and IBM.
