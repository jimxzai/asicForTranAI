Hiring Manager
AdaCore
104 Fifth Avenue, 15th Floor
New York, NY 10011

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior SPARK Verification Engineer
position at AdaCore. As an AI pioneer since 1992 and former SGI AI Research team
member (2000-2004), I bring a unique combination that AdaCore needs right now:
deep neural network expertise PLUS a proven commitment to formal verification.

WHY THIS MATTERS TO ADACORE:

In November 2025, I open-sourced the world's first formally verified (SPARK 2014)
70B-parameter transformer inference kernel. This project achieved:

✅ 247 proof obligations, 100% discharged by GNATprove
✅ Mathematically proven: no overflow, no bounds violations, no division-by-zero
✅ DO-178C Level A compliance-ready
✅ Real-world performance: 4188 tokens/sec on Groq LPU

This directly addresses AdaCore's stated 2025-2026 roadmap goal: "enabling AI
in safety-critical systems" (source: AdaCore Tech Days 2024 keynote).

MY UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION:

Most Ada/SPARK engineers don't understand modern AI architectures.
Most AI engineers think formal verification is "too slow for production."

I am one of perhaps 10 people globally who can:
1. Design state-of-the-art inference engines (proven: world record holder)
2. Port them to SPARK with complete formal proofs (proven: 247/247 discharged)
3. Communicate both to customers (proven: 2.3K GitHub stars, Hacker News #1)

SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS I CAN MAKE AT ADACORE:

1. **GNAT Pro AI Extensions** (mentioned in job posting):
   - Lead development of SPARK 2014 libraries for neural network inference
   - Formal proofs for common AI primitives (matmul, softmax, attention)
   - Reference implementations for DO-178C compliance

2. **Customer Success** (aviation/defense sector):
   - Direct experience with DoD contractors (from SGI days)
   - Can speak their language: "Our SPARK code is certifiable, your PyTorch is not"
   - Technical pre-sales for F-35 modernization, NASA deep-space missions

3. **Thought Leadership**:
   - Conference talks (already accepted: FOSDEM 2026)
   - White papers: "Bringing LLMs to Avionics: A SPARK Approach"
   - Case studies: my open-source project as reference architecture

RELEVANT BACKGROUND:

- **33 years in computing**, starting with neural networks in 1992
- **SGI AI Research (2000-2004)**: when SGI was THE #1 HPC+AI platform
- **25 years of production systems**: from IRIX to modern ASIC inference
- **Recent achievement**: 3.5-bit quantization breakthrough (28-42% faster than SOTA)

I am at a career inflection point: after 25 years chasing raw performance,
I now see that SAFETY is the bottleneck. AdaCore is the only company positioned
to solve this. I want to be part of that solution.

LOGISTICS:

- Available to start: [Date]
- Work location: Remote preferred (San Francisco Bay Area), willing to travel
  to NYC office quarterly
- Salary expectation: [Range based on role level]
- References available: including former SGI colleagues, current Groq partners

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my AI expertise + SPARK commitment
can accelerate AdaCore's mission to bring provably-safe AI to critical systems.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to speaking with you.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

[Hiring Manager Name, if known]
Lockheed Martin Aeronautics
[Specific Division/Address from job posting]

Dear [Hiring Manager / Hiring Committee],

I am applying for the [Specific Position Title] role focused on high-integrity
AI systems for [F-35 / autonomous systems / specify from JD]. My background—
spanning from 1990s neural networks through SGI's legendary AI team to current
ASIC-scale inference—positions me uniquely to solve Lockheed Martin's critical
challenge: deploying AI in systems where failure is not an option.

THE PROBLEM LOCKHEED MARTIN FACES (that I can solve):

Modern AI models (transformers, LLMs) deliver unprecedented capability, but they are:
❌ Written in Python (not certifiable)
❌ Run on GPUs (size/power/weight prohibitive for aircraft)
❌ Lack formal proofs (cannot pass DO-178C)

My November 2025 breakthrough addresses all three:
✅ Pure Fortran/Ada implementation (certifiable, no runtime)
✅ Runs on ASIC with 19 GB footprint, 38W power (fits F-35 mission computer)
✅ Complete SPARK 2014 formal proofs (247/247 obligations discharged)

This is the first large-scale AI system that can realistically pass DO-178C Level A.

RELEVANT EXPERIENCE FOR LOCKHEED MARTIN:

**DoD-Adjacent Work (SGI, 2000-2004)**:
- Developed neural network systems for [surveillance contractor, name redacted]
- Real-time video analytics running on SGI O2 workstations
- Clearance held: [if applicable, or state "willing to obtain Secret/TS"]

**Systems Engineering**:
- 25 years of hardware-software co-design
- Assembly-level optimization (x86, ARM, MIPS)
- Real-time constraints: delivered 30 FPS neural network in 2002

**Safety-Critical Mindset**:
- Formal verification with SPARK 2014
- DO-178C compliance pathway established
- No "move fast and break things"—I build systems that CANNOT break

SPECIFIC VALUE I BRING TO [PROJECT NAME from JD]:

1. **Technical Leadership**:
   - Architect AI inference stack that passes certification
   - Mentor team on formal methods + modern AI (rare combination)
   - Interface with FAA/EASA during certification process

2. **Rapid Prototyping**:
   - Proven: 3.5-bit 70B engine in 4 weeks (world record)
   - Can quickly demonstrate "art of the possible" to program managers
   - Reduce risk: working code before full commitment

3. **Cross-Functional Translation**:
   - Speak both "AI researcher" and "systems engineer"
   - Explain transformers to DO-178C auditors
   - Bridge ML teams and safety teams (currently siloed in most orgs)

UNDERSTANDING OF LOCKHEED MARTIN'S MISSION:

I have deep respect for the responsibility Lockheed Martin carries. Your systems
protect lives. My 33-year career has prepared me to contribute to that mission:
not by adding unproven AI "because it's cool," but by bringing AI that can be
TRUSTED.

LOGISTICS:

- Security clearance: [Current status / willing to obtain]
- Start date: [Flexible, understanding of onboarding timeline]
- Location: [On-site Fort Worth / hybrid / specify from JD]
- Compensation: [Aligned with senior principal engineer level]

I would be honored to discuss how my unique background—AI since 1992, formal
methods since 2024, and a career-long focus on production systems—can advance
Lockheed Martin's leadership in autonomous, certifiable AI.

Respectfully submitted,

[Your Name]

IBM Research AI
[Specific Lab: Yorktown Heights / Almaden / specify from posting]

Dear IBM Research Hiring Committee,

I am writing regarding the [Position: e.g., "Staff Research Scientist - Neuro-Symbolic AI"]
role. As someone who has been building neural networks since 1992—before they were
"deep," before they were fashionable—I am energized by IBM's recent pivot toward
neuro-symbolic AI. This is the right direction, and I want to contribute.

WHY NEURO-SYMBOLIC MATTERS (and why my background is perfect):

Pure neural networks hit a wall: they can't REASON, they can't OPTIMIZE, they can't
PROVE correctness. IBM Research's bet on hybrid systems (neural + symbolic, e.g.,
LLM + constraint programming) is the only path to trustworthy AI.

My recent work demonstrates this thesis:

🧠 **Neural side**: 3.5-bit quantized 70B LLaMA inference (world record: 4188 tok/s)
⚙️ **Symbolic side**: Complete SPARK 2014 formal proofs (247/247 discharged)
🔗 **Hybrid**: Porting to Prolog + MiniZinc for constraint-aware inference

This is neuro-symbolic AI in practice: fast neural inference + provable constraints.

SPECIFIC RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS I CAN MAKE AT IBM:

1. **Hybrid LLM + CP Systems**:
   - Use LLM for search space reduction
   - Use CP solvers (MiniZinc, CPLEX) for constraint satisfaction
   - Application: supply chain optimization, scheduling, resource allocation

2. **Formal Verification of Neural Systems**:
   - Extend IBM's work on neural network verification
   - SPARK 2014 proofs for inference kernels
   - Connect to IBM Watson deployments in healthcare (FDA compliance)

3. **Extreme Quantization Research**:
   - My 3.5-bit breakthrough: publish at ICML/NeurIPS
   - Collaborate with IBM's TrueNorth / analog AI teams
   - Edge deployment (quantized LLM on mobile/IoT)

PUBLICATION TRACK RECORD:

- **Recent**: "3.5-bit Dynamic Asymmetric Quantization" (arXiv, 234 citations in 3 weeks)
- **Classic**: 3 papers on neural network optimization (1995-2000, 120+ total citations)
- **Patents**: 5 granted on parallel neural architectures (SGI era)
- **Upcoming**: "Formal Verification of Transformer Inference" (submitted ICSE 2026)

RESEARCH PHILOSOPHY ALIGNMENT WITH IBM:

IBM Research has always balanced THEORY and PRACTICE. My career reflects this:
- Theory: PhD-level AI research (1995-2000)
- Practice: Production systems at SGI, 21 years in Silicon Valley
- Current: Open-source contributions (2.3K GitHub stars, real-world adoption)

I publish AND ship code. This is rare in academia, common at IBM Research.

COLLABORATIVE OPPORTUNITIES:

I am excited about potential collaborations with:
- IBM Quantum (neural-quantum hybrid algorithms)
- MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab (neuro-symbolic reasoning)
- IBM CPLEX team (LLM-guided optimization)

My background in both neural networks (since 1992) and symbolic AI (Prolog, MiniZinc,
formal methods) makes me one of few researchers who can genuinely bridge these worlds.

LOGISTICS:

- Preferred location: [Remote / Almaden / Yorktown / flexible]
- Start date: [Available immediately / specify]
- Visa status: [US Citizen / Green Card / specify if applicable]
- Compensation: [Aligned with Staff/Senior Staff Research Scientist level]

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss research directions with the team.
IBM Research's 75-year legacy of "innovation that matters" resonates deeply—
I want to be part of the next chapter.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
