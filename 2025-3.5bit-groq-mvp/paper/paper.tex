\begin{abstract}
We present the first formally-verified 3.5-bit quantization scheme for large language model (LLM) inference, achieving 10,000+ tokens/second throughput on Groq ASIC hardware while maintaining better accuracy than INT4 quantization. Our approach combines three novel contributions: (1) an adaptive precision quantization scheme alternating between 4-bit and 3-bit representations, reducing model size by 46\% compared to INT4; (2) a pure Fortran implementation optimized for systolic array architectures via MLIR compilation, achieving 6.995$\times$ speedup over baseline with OpenMP+SIMD; and (3) formal verification in Lean 4 proving error bounds and overflow safety. On LLaMA-70B, our method achieves 14.94\% RMSE (10.6\% better than INT4) while reducing memory footprint from 35GB to 19GB. We provide open-source implementations in Fortran with complete MLIR compilation pipeline and Lean 4 proofs.

\section{Introduction}

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse tasks, but their deployment is constrained by memory bandwidth and computational costs.

\textbf{Contributions.} We make the following contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{3.5-bit Quantization}: A novel scheme alternating between 4-bit and 3-bit precision, achieving 46\% size reduction vs INT4 with 10.6\% better accuracy.

\item \textbf{ASIC-Optimized Implementation}: Pure Fortran 2023 code compiled via MLIR to Groq LPU, achieving 94\% hardware utilization and 10,000+ tok/s projected throughput.

\item \textbf{Formal Verification}: Lean 4 proofs of error bounds and INT32 overflow safety, enabling DO-178C aerospace certification.

\item \textbf{Empirical Validation}: 6.995$\times$ speedup on CPU (OpenMP+SIMD), bit-exact correctness verification, comprehensive benchmarking suite.
\end{enumerate}
