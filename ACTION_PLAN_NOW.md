## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:

1. **Over-promise on the history**
   - ✅ DO: "I have numerical computing background"
   - ❌ DON'T: "I won awards in 1990" (unless you have proof)

2. **Apologize for your work**
   - ✅ DO: "I built the world's first 3.5-bit verified LLM"
   - ❌ DON'T: "It's not perfect, but..."

3. **Undersell the innovation**
   - ✅ DO: "This is novel and impactful"
   - ❌ DON'T: "I'm not sure if this is interesting..."

4. **Spam everyone**
   - ✅ DO: Send 10 well-researched emails
   - ❌ DON'T: Send 100 generic emails

5. **Give up after 1 week**
   - ✅ DO: Follow up after 5 business days
   - ❌ DON'T: Assume silence = rejection

6. **Accept first offer without negotiating**
   - ✅ DO: "That's interesting. Can I think about it for a few days?"
   - ❌ DON'T: "Yes!" immediately

```
Yes, I'm open to the right opportunity. Particularly interested in:
• ASIC inference optimization (Groq, Cerebras, etc.)
• Safety-critical AI (aviation, medical devices)
• Formal verification for production systems

Would love to discuss what you're working on.
```

**Reply** (if you want consulting):
```
I'm currently focused on my open-source work, but open to consulting engagements around:
• DO-178C certification for ML systems
• Quantization optimization for ASICs
• SPARK/Lean formal verification

Happy to discuss project-based collaboration.
```
