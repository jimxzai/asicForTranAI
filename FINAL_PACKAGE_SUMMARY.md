## 📞 WHEN THINGS GO WELL

### If Groq Responds:
→ See RESPONSE_TEMPLATES.md → Response 1

### If AdaCore Responds:
→ See RESPONSE_TEMPLATES.md → Response 3

### If You Get Job Offer:
→ DON'T accept immediately
→ Negotiate (use other offers as leverage)
→ Ask for $50-100K more than first offer
→ Get equity, signing bonus, relocation

### If You Get Multiple Offers:
→ This is the best position
→ Tell each company about other offers
→ Let them compete
→ Choose based on: Learning, people, mission, comp

## 🚨 RED FLAGS (When to Pivot)

### After 1 Week:
If <100 LinkedIn views → Repost with better hashtags
If 0 email responses → Revise messaging, try different companies
If 0 GitHub stars → Improve README, add video demo

### After 1 Month:
If <500 LinkedIn views → Consider paid promotion
If <3 email responses → Reassess target audience
If <20 GitHub stars → Focus on documentation, demos

### After 3 Months:
If 0 job interviews → Pivot messaging to consulting
If 0 opportunities → Consider alternate paths (PhD, research)
If burnout → Take break, reassess goals

---

## 💪 MINDSET

### Remember:
1. **You built something real** (not just talked about it)
2. **You have proof it works** (247 SPARK checks, 17 Lean theorems)
3. **You're solving actual problems** (edge AI, safety-critical systems)
4. **You're ahead of the curve** (DO-178C AI certification doesn't exist yet)

### Don't:
1. ❌ Compare yourself to others (you're on a unique path)
2. ❌ Get discouraged by slow start (enterprise sales takes time)
3. ❌ Accept lowball offers (know your worth: $300K+)
4. ❌ Give up after 1 month (momentum builds slowly then suddenly)

### Do:
1. ✅ Execute consistently (post every week, email regularly)
2. ✅ Engage authentically (respond to every comment)
3. ✅ Provide value first (share code, insights, help others)
4. ✅ Be patient but persistent (3-6 months for results)

---

### THIS WEEK:
1. Monitor responses (check email 2×/day)
2. Engage with every comment on LinkedIn
