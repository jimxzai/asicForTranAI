## 🎓 Email Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- **Keep it concise**: 300-500 words max
- **Lead with value**: What's in it for them?
- **Include attachment**: PDF overview (don't make them search)
- **Clear ask**: Developer access OR research collaboration
- **Timeline**: NeurIPS 2026 creates urgency
- **Follow up**: If no response in 5 business days

### Don'ts ❌
- **Don't oversell**: Avoid "revolutionary" or "game-changing"
- **Don't rush**: Give them 3-5 days to respond
- **Don't multi-track**: Don't CC multiple departments
- **Don't attach code**: Keep it professional (link to GitHub only)
- **Don't demand**: Request, don't require

### Subject Line Testing
Original: "Formally Verified 3.5-bit LLM Inference for Groq LPU"

Alternatives (if no response):
- "NeurIPS 2026: Verified LLM Inference on Groq LPU"
- "Safety-Critical LLM Partnership - Groq Developer Access"
- "177 GB LLaMA-405B on Cerebras WSE (All On-Chip)"

## 🔍 What to Expect

### Groq Response Timeline
- **Best**: 1-2 days (developer relations team)
- **Typical**: 3-5 days (escalated to engineering)
- **Worst**: 7+ days (auto-response or no reply)

**If no response in 5 days**: Send follow-up or try LinkedIn

### Cerebras Response Timeline
- **Best**: 2-3 days (research team engaged)
- **Typical**: 5-7 days (routed to technical lead)
- **Worst**: 10+ days (academic timelines are slower)

**If no response in 7 days**: Send follow-up emphasizing NeurIPS deadline

### Positive Signals
- 🟢 Request for call = Very interested
- 🟢 Ask for code/repo = Technical validation
- 🟢 CC'd internal team = Escalated interest
- 🟡 Request more info = Cautiously interested
- 🔴 Generic "thanks for reaching out" = Polite rejection

- **PDF size**: 48KB (excellent, well under 1MB limit)
- **Gmail/Outlook**: No issues with delivery
- **Mobile-friendly**: Easy to read on phone

**Tracking**:
- **Read receipts**: Optional (some find intrusive)
