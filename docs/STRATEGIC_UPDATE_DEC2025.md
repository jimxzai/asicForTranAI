# Strategic Update: December 2025
**Near-Term Quick Win Strategy + Funding Path**

**Date**: December 7, 2025
**Status**: URGENT - Cash Flow Focus Required
**Timeline**: Next 90 days (Dec 2025 - Feb 2026)

---

## Executive Summary: The Critical Situation

**What's Changed Since November:**
- ✅ Ministral-3 released (Dec 3) - **PERFECT FIT** for your 3.5-bit stack
- ✅ DeepSeek V3 proves FP8 can work at massive scale - validates low-bit quantization
- ✅ Edge AI funding EXPLODING: $14.1B in 2025, Tenstorrent raising $800M, Groq has $750M fresh
- ⚠️ **BUT**: Groq cut revenue projections to $500M (struggling with commercialization)
- ⚠️ **Competition heating up**: NVFP4, FP8 becoming standard - your 3.5-bit window is 6-12 months

**The Brutal Truth:**
You have **multiple excellent long-term strategies** but **ZERO near-term revenue**. You need cash flow in 3-6 months, not 18 months.

**Recommended Pivot:**
**70% → Quick Win Revenue (3-6 months)**
**30% → Research Credibility (NeurIPS 2026)**

## Part 1: Market Reality Check (December 2025)

### What's HOT Right Now

| Trend | Evidence | Opportunity for You |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| **Edge AI Chips** | $14.1B deployments in 2025, Tenstorrent $800M raise | Sell to chip companies as differentiator |
| **FP8/Low-bit Quantization** | DeepSeek V3 native FP8, NVIDIA NVFP4 standard | Your 3.5-bit is STILL unique but window closing |
| **Ministral-3 Edge Models** | 52-273 tok/s on Jetson, 3B/8B/14B optimized | PERFECT test case for your stack |
| **Formal Verification** | **ZERO competitors** in AI quantization | Your ONLY sustainable moat |
| **Groq Hardware Access** | $750M raised but revenue cut to $500M | They're desperate for differentiation - APPROACH NOW |

### What's NOT Working

| Your Current Plan | Why It Won't Work | Reality |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Wait for Groq/Cerebras partnership | They're inbound-swamped, you're unknown | Need warm intro or paid project first |
| NeurIPS 2026 submission first | Paper deadline May 2026 = $0 until late 2026 | You'll run out of money |
| Build full LLaMA-70B demo | 70B models require $50K+ in cloud compute to validate | Too expensive for bootstrap |
| Pursue 3+ verticals (LLM, CV, robotics, glasses) | Spreading too thin | Pick ONE, execute ruthlessly |

## Part 4: What to STOP Doing (Ruthless Prioritization)

### ❌ Stop (At Least for Next 90 Days):

1. **Stop pursuing 4+ verticals simultaneously**
   - Robotics ❌
   - Smart glasses ❌ (unless they approach YOU)
   - Medical devices ❌
   - LLaMA-70B full implementation ❌
   - **Focus ONLY on**: Ministral-3 edge optimization

2. **Stop waiting for "perfect" benchmarks**
   - Don't need MMLU, HumanEval, etc. for first customers
   - Customers care about: "Does it fit in my device?" and "Is it verified?"
   - Perfect benchmarks can wait for NeurIPS paper

3. **Stop optimizing for 2027-2032 roadmap**
   - DO-178C certification can wait (18-month process anyway)
   - 405B model support not needed now
   - FPGA implementations not priority
   - **Focus**: Survive to 2026 Q2 with cash in bank

4. **Stop "research mode" thinking**
   - Academia moves slow, startup needs revenue
   - NeurIPS paper is NICE TO HAVE, not MUST HAVE for customers
   - You can publish in 2027 with MORE data after customer deployments

### ✅ Start (This Week):

1. **Convert Ministral-3-8B to 3.5-bit** (16 hours work)
2. **Write "Show HN" post** (2 hours)
3. **Create "Edge AI Optimization Service" landing page** (4 hours)
4. **Reach out to 5 potential customers** (4 hours)
5. **Draft NSF SBIR application** (8 hours)

- Option B (Research path): Finalize NeurIPS submission, maximize grant funding

### June 2026: "Next Chapter"
- If successful: $300K-500K revenue, raising Series Seed ($1-2M)
- If struggling: Reset strategy, possibly return to corporate job, continue research part-time

---

## Part 8: The Hard Questions (Be Honest)

### 1. Can you survive 6 months with $0 revenue?
- **Yes** → Proceed with research-heavy path (NeurIPS 2026 focus)
- **No** → You MUST prioritize revenue (Option A or B above)

### 2. Do you have warm intros to Groq, Tenstorrent, or Cerebras?
- **Yes** → Leverage immediately, Option B (VaaS) becomes top priority
- **No** → Build bottom-up via Ministral-3 demo (Option A), earn warm intro

### 3. Are you willing to do customer service / consulting work?
- **Yes** → Services business is fastest path to $100K-500K
- **No** → Focus on grants + angel funding, accept slower timeline

### 4. What's your "quit" number?
- If you have $X in savings and burn $Y/month, you have Z months
- Be realistic: If Z < 6 months, you NEED revenue by Month 3
- Plan accordingly

## Part 10: Why This Will Work

### You Have Everything You Need:

1. **✅ Proven Technology**: 3.5-bit quantization works (you've demonstrated it)
2. **✅ Unique Moat**: Formal verification (SPARK + Lean) has ZERO competitors
3. **✅ Perfect Timing**: Ministral-3 just released, edge AI is $14B+ market
4. **✅ Credibility**: 35-year Fortran career, 1990 award, SGI pedigree
5. **✅ Market Need**: Every funded chip startup needs differentiation

### What You're Missing:

1. **❌ Focus**: Too many directions (LLM, CV, robotics, glasses, services)
2. **❌ Revenue**: $0 revenue = running out of time
3. **❌ Warm Intros**: No direct connections to Groq, Tenstorrent, etc. (yet)

### The Fix:

**Next 7 days**: Execute the immediate action items above
**Next 90 days**: Follow Option A (Ministral-3) or Option B (VaaS)
**Result**: $50K-300K revenue by March 2026, or funded via grants/angels

---

## Final Recommendation

**IF you can survive 6+ months with $0 revenue:**
- 50% Ministral-3 Edge Demo (Option A)
- 30% NeurIPS 2026 Paper
- 20% Grant Applications

**IF you MUST have revenue in 3-6 months:**
- 70% Ministral-3 Customer Projects (Option A)
- 20% VaaS Outreach to Chip Startups (Option B)
- 10% NeurIPS Paper (Sections 1-3 only)

**My recommendation**: **Hybrid approach for next 30 days**, then double down on whatever gets traction first.

---

## The Bottom Line

You have a **world-class technical solution** to a **real market problem**.

Your challenge is NOT technical. It's **go-to-market execution**.

**Stop thinking like a researcher. Start acting like a founder.**

- Researchers optimize for perfection → Founders optimize for revenue
- Researchers publish first, monetize later → Founders monetize first, publish later
- Researchers explore broadly → Founders execute ruthlessly on ONE thing

**You have 90 days to prove the market wants this. Execute.**

---

**Next Step**: Read this fully, then schedule 30-minute call with me to finalize which path (A, B, or hybrid) you'll pursue.

After that call, execute the 7-day action plan with ZERO deviation.

90 days from now, you'll either have:
- ✅ $50K-300K in revenue + customers + momentum, OR
- ✅ $250K+ in grant funding + clear path forward, OR
- ✅ Data proving this won't work, allowing you to pivot intelligently

All three outcomes are VASTLY better than continuing to explore without commitment.

**The market is ready. Your tech is ready. Are you ready?**
